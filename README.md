# RAG Based Chatbot Task

Objective: Your goal for this task is to describe how you would implement a chatbot that will let people chat with PDFs. More specifically, the PDFs are installation manuals for different equipment found in homes (Air Conditioners, Sinks, Water heaters etc.). Here’s an example of such a PDF file.

Detailed Requirements:
Describe each component of the RAG system (embedder, PDF processor, vector DB, LLM response generation etc.). For each component, describe how you would choose which tool to use (e.g. for the embedding model I will choose to use openAI embeddings because of ….). You can also present certain tools and discuss why you wouldn’t use them.
Describe at least 2 challenges that you will encounter when using the tool(s) that you chose (e.g. when using openAI embeddings, the vector size is too long …), and try to think of how you can overcome those challenges.
Once you complete choosing the tools, present 5 examples of complex questions that the chatbot you designed will be able to answer, and 5 examples of questions that your chatbot will fail to answer. Present reasons why.

Submission: Write all the answers to the above questions in a markdown file, and upload it in a publicly available github repository and submit using this google form. Feel free to add diagrams or any other graphical things that would help you emphasize your points.
